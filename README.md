Authors: [Natalia Kim](https://github.com/nattikim), [Maxim Mikhailov](https://github.com/maximihajlov)

A smart road simulation using the Rust programming language and the Macroquad library. 
The project aims to design a new traffic strategy algorithm for autonomous vehicles (AVs) 
to pass an intersection without collisions and with minimal congestion.

The project was implemented as a part of the Grit:lab coding school curriculum (01Edu platform), November 2023.
